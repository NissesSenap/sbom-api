# sbom-api

This is a PoC that I'm playing with to see if I can build an API to store and visualize SBOMs.

## Goals

- store the unchanged SBOM per application in a object storeage
- Support attesation out of the box generated by SLSA (extra info)
- Visualize dependecy licenses
- Visualize CVEs based on package version

## Generate SBOM

It's always good to have something to test with, So lets on our own app.
To generate the SBOM I currently use [cdxgen](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cdxgen)

There are many tools to generate SBOM, but since I'm focusing on CycloneDX for starters, it seems rensoanbele to use it.
I will st

### golang

```shell
cdxgen -t golang -o go-bom.json .
```

### Container image

```shell
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=ko.local
ko build --sbom=none --bare --platform linux/amd64 -t test1 --image-refs .digest main.go

# tell cdxgen to gather licenses from the generated docker artifact
export FETCH_LICENSE=true
cdxgen -t oci ko.local:5b7b28cfdd64a6217228283bea8e6ca0e7d746c6a770ca88976610ec650b97be -spec-version  1.6 -o container-bom.json
```
